# Flex Box
[Flexy box](https://github.com/kapena/FlexyBoxes/blob/master/flexyBox.mdown) is a document I created with notes and demos that I used to learn the concepts of the Flexible Box layout. I referenced all the sources listed bellow. 

Another really cool post that helped me with flex box is [a visual guide to flexbox layout.](https://scotch.io/tutorials/a-visual-guide-to-css3-flexbox-properties) This article has great visuals on flex box concepts and syntax.

I also referenced from the W3C spec. Yeah it can be a little overwhelming but it's where flex box is documented most accurately.[CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1](http://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-basis).

The last thing I'd like to add in is a really cool web app that helped me visualize some flex box layouts. Play around with it! It's supper awesome! [Flex box is 5](http://flexboxin5.com/)
