# Flex Box
[Flexy box](https://github.com/kapena/FlexyBoxes/blob/master/flexyBox.mdown) is a document I created with notes and demos that I used to learn the concepts of the Flexible Box layout. I referenced a few sources which taught me how to use Flex Box, I've listed each source bellow. Feel free to read my notes and try the demos!

Some of the information in my post is from [Dive into flex box](http://bocoup.com/weblog/dive-into-flexbox/). This is a great article on all that flex box has to offer.

Another really cool place for learning flex box is [a visual guide to flex box layout.](https://scotch.io/tutorials/a-visual-guide-to-css3-flexbox-properties) This tutorial has great visuals on explaining all the concepts flex box related. This is a must read.  

Last but not least I referenced from the W3C spec. Yeah it can be a little overwhelming but it's where flex box is documented most accurately, so don't feel afraid to look at the [CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1](http://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-basis).
